## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze and build a predictive model that identifies factors influencing lead conversion. The model helps in recommending strategies to optimize sales team efforts and improve lead conversion rates. 

## General Steps for Model Development

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Gather data from available sources (e.g., CRM, website analytics) related to lead interactions, conversions, and engagement metrics.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing/standardizing numerical features.
   - Split the dataset into training and test sets to ensure model validation.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Create relevant features that could impact lead conversion (e.g., total time spent on the website, number of interactions, source of the lead, etc.).
   - Generate dummy variables for categorical features to make them usable in the model.

4. **Model Building:**
   - Train a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.) to predict the probability of a lead converting to a sale.
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.

5. **Variable Importance:**
   - Identify the top contributing variables in the model using feature importance metrics to understand what drives conversion rates the most.
   
6. **Strategy Recommendations:**
   - Based on model insights, create actionable strategies for different phases:
     - Aggressive conversion strategy during the intern phase, focusing on high-conversion probability leads.
     - Minimization of unnecessary calls during the post-target phase, based on engagement and probability scores.

7. **Model Deployment & Monitoring:**
   - Deploy the model in a real-time environment where sales teams can use it to prioritize leads.
   - Regularly monitor the model's performance and retrain with new data if necessary.

## Model Output
- **Top Contributing Variables**: Provides insights into the most important variables affecting lead conversion.
- **Top Categorical Variables**: Highlights the categorical variables that most influence the conversion process.
- **Phase Strategies**: Recommends actions during different sales team phases (intern phase vs. post-target phase).

## How to Use
1. **Prepare your dataset** in the same format as used in this project, ensuring all relevant features are included.
2. **Run the model** using the provided Python scripts. Ensure dependencies like `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `matplotlib` are installed.
3. **Evaluate the results** using the output metrics and review the recommended strategies based on model insights.
4. **Deploy the model** in a real-world sales scenario to help optimize lead conversion.
